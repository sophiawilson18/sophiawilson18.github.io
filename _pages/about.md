Sophia is an incoming PhD student in the Sustainable Machine Learning group at the Machine Learning (ML) Section, Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen (UCPH). Her research focuses on resource-efficient ML and the intersection of ML and physics.  

 Sophia holds a MSc degree in Computational Physcsi from the Niels Bohr Institute, UCPH, where she worked on developing ML methods that leverage physical knowledge to improve the efficiency and interpretability of ML models. Here, she was supervised by [Raghavendra Selvan](https://raghavian.github.io/) and [Jens Hesselbjerg Christensen](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=kFbQdMYAAAAJ&hl=en). 

 During her BSc. studies, she conducted research at the [Cosmic Dawn Center](https://cosmicdawn.dk/) focusing on estimating hydrogen gas masses in high-redshift galaxies and measuring cosmological parameters using fast radio bursts.
