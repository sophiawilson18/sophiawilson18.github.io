Sophia is an incoming PhD student in the Sustainable Machine Learning group at the Machine Learning (ML) Section, Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen (UCPH). Her research focuses on resource-efficient ML and the intersection of ML and physics.

She holds a MSc degree in Computational Physics from the Niels Bohr Institute, UCPH, where she developed ML methods that incorporate physical knowledge to improve the energy efficiency of models. Her master’s work was supervised by [Raghavendra Selvan](https://raghavian.github.io/) and [Jens Hesselbjerg Christensen](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=kFbQdMYAAAAJ&hl=en). 

During her BSc studies, she conducted research at the [Cosmic Dawn Center](https://cosmicdawn.dk/), focusing on estimating hydrogen gas masses in high-redshift galaxies and measuring cosmological parameters using fast radio bursts, under the supervision of [Kasper Heintz](https://keheintz.github.io/).
