I am a PhD student at the [SAINTS Lab](https://saintslab.github.io/) in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH). My research is at the intersection of AI and environmental sustainability, and specifically on data- and ressource-efficient machine learning (ML). I am supervised by [Raghavendra Selvan](https://raghavian.github.io/) and [Erik Dam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WCP-mBEAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I hold a MSc degree in Computational Physics from the Niels Bohr Institute, UCPH, where I explored physics-informed ML as a way to reduce energy use and carbon emissions of ML models. My master’s thesis was supervised by [Raghavendra Selvan](https://raghavian.github.io/) and [Jens Hesselbjerg Christensen](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=kFbQdMYAAAAJ&hl=en).

During my BSc studies, I conducted research at the [Cosmic Dawn Center](https://cosmicdawn.dk/), focusing on estimating hydrogen gas masses in high-redshift galaxies and measuring cosmological parameters using fast radio bursts, under the supervision of [Kasper Heintz](https://keheintz.github.io/).
